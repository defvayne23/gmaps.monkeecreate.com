# gMaps.monkeeCreate.com

Website for the jQuery [gMaps](http://github.com/defvayne23/gMaps) plugin. Powered by Jekyll. All docs and examples are under the MIT license.

## Contribute
Done something pretty awesome with gMaps? Have a great example you want to show off? Fork the site and add it!

#### Run Locally
* If you don't already have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed do it now.
* Get the website source and latest copy of gMaps with `git clone --recursive git@github.com:defvayne23/gmaps.monkeecreate.com.git`.
* Run `gem install jekyll` if you don't already have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
* Then run `npm install` to grab latest dependencies.
* Finally run `jekyll serve --watch`.
* You should be able to access the site at http://localhost:4000.

#### Add An Example
*This is a work in progress and will be cleaned up as initial set of examples get added and a format is established.*

All examples are stored in `./_posts/` and it's recommended to duplicate the Basic Example to avoid missing post tags. jQuery, Google Maps API, and gMaps are loaded on every page so no need to include them. Try to keep your example straight forward and include full source. Current categories your example should fall under are General, Markers, Polylines, Polygons, and Circles.
